# nm-objdump
{EPITECH} | Second year | Unix porgraming - Memory

The goal is to code an equivalent to the system commands nm without any options and objdump with -fs option.

You must handle a variable number of parameters.
The display produced MUST be the same as the one on your dump.

The programs must work with the following:
- relocatable files .o & .a
- shared files .so
- executable files
